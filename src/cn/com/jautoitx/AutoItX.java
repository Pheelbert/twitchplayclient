		 * Sends simulated keystrokes to the active window.
		 * 
		 * See the Appendix for some tips.
		 * 
		 * The "Send" command syntax is similar to that of ScriptIt and the
		 * Visual Basic "SendKeys" command. Characters are sent as written with
		 * the exception of the following characters:
		 * 
		 * '!' This tells AutoIt to send an ALT keystroke, therefore
		 * Send("This is text!a") would send the keys "This is text" and then
		 * press "ALT+a".
		 * 
		 * N.B. Some programs are very choosy about capital letters and ALT
		 * keys, i.e. "!A" is different to "!a". The first says ALT+SHIFT+A, the
		 * second is ALT+a. If in doubt, use lowercase!
		 * 
		 * '+' This tells AutoIt to send a SHIFT keystroke, therefore
		 * Send("Hell+o") would send the text "HellO". Send("!+a") would send
		 * "ALT+SHIFT+a".
		 * 
		 * '^' This tells AutoIt to send a CONTROL keystroke, therefore
		 * Send("^!a") would send "CTRL+ALT+a".
		 * 
		 * N.B. Some programs are very choosy about capital letters and CTRL
		 * keys, i.e. "^A" is different to "^a". The first says CTRL+SHIFT+A,
		 * the second is CTRL+a. If in doubt, use lowercase!
		 * 
		 * '#' The hash now sends a Windows keystroke; therefore, Send("#r")
		 * would send Win+r which launches the Run dialog box.
		 * 
		 * You can set SendCapslockMode to make CAPS LOCK disabled at the start
		 * of a Send operation and restored upon completion. However, if a user
		 * is holding down the Shift key when a Send function begins, text may
		 * be sent in uppercase. One workaround is to
		 * Send("{SHIFTDOWN}{SHIFTUP}") before the other Send operations.
		 * 
		 * Certain special keys can be sent and should be enclosed in braces:
		 * 
		 * N.B. Windows does not allow the simulation of the "CTRL-ALT-DEL"
		 * combination!
		 * 
		 * To send the ASCII value A (same as pressing ALT+065 on the numeric
		 * keypad) Send("{ASC 65}")
		 * 
		 * Single keys can also be repeated, e.g. Send("{DEL 4}") ;Presses the
		 * DEL key 4 times Send("{S 30}") ;Sends 30 'S' characters Send("+{TAB
		 * 4}) ;Presses SHIFT+TAB 4 times
		 * 
		 * To hold a key down (generally only useful for games) Send("{a down}")
		 * ;Holds the A key down Send("{a up}") ;Releases the A key
		 * 
		 * To set the state of the capslock, numlock and scrolllock keys
		 * Send("{NumLock on}") ;Turns the NumLock key on Send("{CapsLock off}")
		 * ;Turns the CapsLock key off Send("{ScrollLock toggle}") ;Toggles the
		 * state of ScrollLock
		 * 
		 * If you with to use a variable for the count, try $n = 4 Send("+{TAB "
		 * & $n & "}")
		 * 
		 * If you wish to send the ASCII value A four times, then try $x =
		 * Chr(65) Send("{" & $x & " 4}")
		 * 
		 * Most laptop computer keyboards have a special Fn key. This key cannot
		 * be simulated.
		 * 
		 * Note, by setting the flag parameter to 1 the above "special"
		 * processing will be disabled. This is useful when you want to send
		 * some text copied from a variable and you want the text sent exactly
		 * as written.
		 * 
		 * For example, open Folder Options (in the control panel) and try the
		 * following:
		 * 
		 * Use Alt-key combos to access menu items. Also, open Notepad and try
		 * the following: Send("!f") Send Alt+f, the access key for Notepad's
		 * file menu. Try other letters!
		 * 
		 * See Windows' Help--press Win+F1--for a complete list of keyboard
		 * shortcuts if you don't know the importance of Alt+F4, PrintScreen,
		 * Ctrl+C, and so on.
		 * 
		 * @param text
		 *            The sequence of keys to send.
		 * @param flag
		 *            Changes how "keys" is processed: flag = 0 (default), Text
